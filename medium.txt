Controlling peripherals on ROSbot 2.0

We decided to no longer support Python port for hFramework. Our goal is to provide hard real-time controller, and C++ working together with RTOS is a great combination. Python running on STM32 microcontroller is not very real-time sollution. But it worked before :slight_smile:

You can write ROS software running on SBC using Python, but you donâ€™t need hFramework o this level. Standard ROS libraries are enough.
 if you want to use python, develop your application in ROS.


ROSbot is an autonomous rover-like robot made by the company Husarion. There are two versions of this robot, "ROSbot 2.0" and "2.0 PRO". This robot can be used for variety of application 
such as mapping and navigation, inspections etc.

hFramework is a library for creating software for mechatronic devices

It has the following ports:

STM32 port for hardware created by Husarion - CORE2, CORE2mini and RoboCORE boards
Linux port for Raspberry Pi and Tinkerboard (experimental)
ESP32 port (experimental)
